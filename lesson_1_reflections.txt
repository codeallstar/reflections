How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It pinpointed the changed lines so that I only had to look at the changed lines for the mistake in the code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would allow me to recover from mistakes faster as well as compare changes made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros
You can commit when you want.
Smaller more finite commits.
Easier to read.
Cons
Need to be diligent about commits
Can lose work if you forget

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

While coding you can make a change to a function that affects multiple files. Google Docs changes are saved on one document because a change will not affect other documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

The git log file can be used to see all the commits and git diff can be used to compare to files and see what changes were made.
