What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You run git status to see what is all in there and what needs to be committed.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging are allows you to chunk your commits into logical sections as you work.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can stage and unstage your files to make sure there is only one commit per logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches would be helpul if you are going to do an experimental version or different version of the site while the main site stays the same. The main site and the experimental branch can be merged later once the experimental version is ready for prime time.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams helped me visualize the parent child relationship between commits.
