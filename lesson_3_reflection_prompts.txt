When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository so that you could work as a team more effectivly, have a remote backup of your files, and allow
other people easy access to your files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You want to pull changes manually so you have control over what versions of files you have that you are working on.
