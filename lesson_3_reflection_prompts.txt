When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository so that you could work as a team more effectivly, have a remote backup of your files, and allow
other people easy access to your files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You want to pull changes manually so you have control over what versions of files you have that you are working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are clones on github server.
You clone to make a copy of a remote or a local repository.
Branches are seperate branches of the repository you are working on to add a feature etc.
